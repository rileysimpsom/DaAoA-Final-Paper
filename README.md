# DNA Sequencing and Fuzzy Searching: Exploring Algorithms in Bioinformatics

## Overview
This repository accompanies the research paper **"DNA Sequencing and Fuzzy Searching"**, which delves into the application of advanced algorithms in bioinformatics. The study focuses on how fuzzy searching techniques, combined with computational biology, address challenges in DNA sequence alignment, comparison, and database searching.

## Abstract
Bioinformatics plays a pivotal role in modern biology and medicine, enabling the analysis of genetic codes and aiding in the development of novel therapies. This paper explores three key algorithms:
- **Smith-Waterman Algorithm**: A dynamic programming approach for local sequence alignment.
- **BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)**: A heuristic algorithm for rapid sequence similarity searches.
- **Approximate Boyer-Moore Algorithm**: A variation of the Boyer-Moore algorithm supporting approximate string matching.

These algorithms are essential for identifying genetic similarities and variations, especially when handling large datasets with inherent errors or mutations.

## Key Highlights
- Detailed explanation of the **Smith-Waterman**, **BLAST**, and **Approximate Boyer-Moore** algorithms.
- Experimental results comparing the computational efficiency and accuracy of these methods.
